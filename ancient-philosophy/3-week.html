Roles of people. Their appearance. There is the leadership, the scientist, female character but she is masculine, and there is muscle of group which is pretty religious.</p> <p>Look of the things as they are signifiers of meanings.</p> <p>Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure: Symbols are like science.</p> <blockquote><p>Ferdinand de Saussure (/soʊˈsjʊər/;[3] French: [fɛʁdinɑ̃ də sosyʁ]; 26 November 1857 – 22 February 1913) was a Swiss linguist and semiotician. His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century.[4][5] He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics[6][7][8][9] and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.[10]</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>One of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of &quot;the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology.&quot;[11] Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. Prague school linguist Jan Mukařovský writes that Saussure's &quot;discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes&quot;, and that in this development &quot;new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature&quot;.[12] Ruqaiya Hasan argued that &quot;the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure&quot;.[13]</p></blockquote> <p>Roland Barthes generalized semiotics. Mythology of plastics. He says that anything can be a symbol. Signifier, signified and sign. Word, meaning and sign.</p> <p>A generalized meaning is a myth.</p> <p>Italiannes: Fresh, basil, tomato, national reference.

But what about WWII? The Holocaust?</p> <p>The rational of the book. Nazis did horrible things, as horrible people, they have not diverged from <strong>rationalism</strong>, but they perverted it. Reason was not only about the logic, but also included <strong>helping other people</strong>, not only about profits, they become machine like and they forgot people.</p> <p>Dialectics of Enlightment</p> <p><strong>Critical theory</strong> as the reactivation old philosophy. It means not being satisfied with the current situation. We are artists, it's our job to criticise the society.</p> <p><strong>Hannah Arendt - Vita Activa</strong> Ancient Greece as an ideal model of human life action.</p> <ul><li>McGyver's heroism. As modern people, we lost a fair amount of heroism and we almost outsourced our heroism</li> <li>We are not in the wars anymore, we are not fighting and soldiers are fighting for us.</li> <li>Privatized war &amp; danger</li> <li>Actual Action</li> <li>Privatized to cinema/TV</li> <li>And it needs commitments.</li></ul> <p>Today cinema is almost ancient heroism.</p> <h2 id="a-femal-philosopher-hannah-arendt"><a href="#a-femal-philosopher-hannah-arendt" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> A femal philosopher, Hannah Arendt</h2> <p>Although she was an &quot;anti feminist&quot;. And also jew. Also refugee. And she was the lover of Heidegger but Heidegger was a Nazi.

Evil systems are oppressing freedoms, stalin or hitler or nazis are almost the same.</p> <p>Eichmann, was the manager of holocaust, he invented the gas chamber and he was captured in Argentina. Arendt was sent to watch the trial. <strong>Movies to watch: Hannah Arendt Movie</strong></p> <h2 id="banality-of-evil"><a href="#banality-of-evil" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Banality of Evil</h2> <p>Nazis are not barbaric, they lack emotional, the very moment, not intention. They were noble, subtle and well educated but they still lacked thinking. (whatsoever, not even crticism)</p> <p>Biggest evil: Lack of thinking. Taking apart from identity, deniers, it's super hard to accept. Willfull ignorance, because it's easier.</p> <p>Life has it's regular rythim. Everything becomes predictable. Thinking forces people out of rythim.</p> <p>Time of Loneliness is important. To think. To think about things. Takes precious time. <strong>Aristo</strong> said that we need to be alone time to think. (Social media prevents that.)</p> <p><strong>Why we need school, art or students?</strong></p> <p>We go there, The only thing we have. And we have nothing to lose. We are out of the daily rythim. We are more active, questioning and time to think. <strong>Movies to watch: Joker</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Is victimization also lack of thinking?</p></blockquote> <p>Arendt, vita activa. (Reading the handouts)</p> <ul><li>How to be active?</li> <li>What to do?</li> <li>Beyond our jobs.</li> <li>Beyond our identities?</li> <li>What does it mean to be active?</li></ul> <p>Living, actively vs. Thinkin.</p> <p>Activity is social nexus of society.</p> <blockquote><p>Nexus:
noun</p></blockquote> <ol><li>a connection or series of connections linking two or more things.
&quot;the nexus between industry and political power&quot;</li> <li>a central or focal point.
&quot;the nexus of any government in this country is No. 10&quot;</li></ol> <p>Thinking, on the other hand, is contemplative. It's about distancing yourself from yourself.</p> <h2 id="mcgyver"><a href="#mcgyver" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> McGyver</h2> <p>He uses dexterity as a weapon.</p> <blockquote><p>dexterity: skill in performing tasks, especially with the hands.</p></blockquote> <p>He is not using any guns or violence. McGyver thinks before acting. Saves people against robbery. Then, <strong>happy consumers</strong> can go on with shopping.</p> <p>1990's, after velvet revolution, old communist narratives were still evil. They were not believable. We as Czech people were culturally colonbized by amarican culture, immediately.</p> <p>Rudimentary (involving or limited to basic principles) activites, are reflecting basic human condition.</p> <ul><li>labor</li> <li>work</li> <li>action</li></ul> <p>90's was a huge turbulant time and crazy things were happening.</p> <blockquote><p>Aristo, nicomachian ethics.</p></blockquote> <p>Aristo says that people want to be happy.</p> <ol><li>Public opinion review, people, pleasure, happines</li> <li>Then he critises it.</li> <li>Then he puts his own view.</li></ol> <p>Lustful (full of or motivated by lust, greed, or the like) vs. aristo = this kind of people are just like cattles. They eat all day and do nothing. Happiness of our mind.</p> <p>Deeds of polis: Dying for the people. Does not actualise our nature. Substance, can or cannot do.</p> <p>To actualise their essence, in order to realize their potential. Psyche. Mind. Reason. <strong>We need to practice philosophy</strong></p> <p>Similar to enlightment thinkers.</p> <p>The image of happy life is deeply entrenched with labor. (Aristotle disqualifies it.)</p> <p>According to Aristo, labour is:</p> <ol><li>painfull</li> <li>dull</li> <li>nothing human</li> <li>nothing democratic</li> <li>is a must</li> <li>is necessity</li></ol> <p><strong>Hesiodos</strong> says that work is no disgrace. (dignity of work.)</p> <h2 id="athenean-thinking-vs-rest-of-the-world"><a href="#athenean-thinking-vs-rest-of-the-world" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Athenean thinking vs. Rest of the world.</h2> <p>Atheneans, they do not work, women and slaves are working. Rest of the world says that they have to work. Atheneans don't like the rest of the world.</p> <p>Arendt is against the athenean view.</p> <p>Handeln, action is to express uniqueness using speech, utterance. It's about distinctness. We need to step out and take action.</p> <p>Oligarchy, anarchy. Arche means beginning. Someone who started something. Youtube microcelebrities.</p> <ul><li>Action, should be unique. If I change something, action needs to be substantial and life changing.</li></ul> <p><strong>We are the beginners</strong> Human, as far as we begin something.</p> <p><strong>Movies to watch:</strong> Citizen Kane.</p> <p>Whu we are, what we are.</p> <p><strong>We can change</strong> It can be positive or negative.</p> <p>Who is Malala Yusufzai? We explain her by her <strong>ACTIONS</strong>. Greta talks in every distinctive way.
