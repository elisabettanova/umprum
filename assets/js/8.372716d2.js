Prague school linguist Jan Mukařovský writes that Saussure\'s "discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic \'things\'... and from mental processes", and that in this development "new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature".[12] Ruqaiya Hasan argued that "the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure".[13]')])]),e._v(" "),i("p",[e._v("Roland Barthes generalized semiotics.
