## Identity Politics

Useful and unuseful labels. Politics was healthy contest of ideas. Right vs. Left. However it changed. Today is mostly about marketing of ideas and popularism. (Michelle Houllebecq is an important name.)

> Michel Houellebecq (French: [miʃɛl wɛlbɛk]; born Michel Thomas; 26 February 1956)[1] is a French author, filmmaker, and poet.

> His first book was a biographical essay on the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Houellebecq published his first novel, Whatever, in 1994. His next novel, Atomised, published in 1998, brought him international fame as well as controversy. Platform followed in 2001. He published several books of poems, including The Art of Struggle (Le sens du combat) in 1996. After a publicity tour for Platform led to his being taken to court for inciting racial hatred, he moved to Ireland for several years.[2] He currently resides in France,[3] where he has been described as "France’s biggest literary export and, some say, greatest living writer."[4] In 2010 he published La Carte et le Territoire (published the same year in English as The Map and the Territory) which won the prestigious Prix Goncourt; and, in 2015, Submission.

## Concept Portmanteau

* We have to be ready for State Examination
* It's not about our knowledge or opinions but how we use these ideas and knowledge.

## Philosophy

Is mostly footnotes of Plato. We will investigate Plato's cave.

> Protagoras (/proʊˈtæɡərəs/; Greek: Πρωταγόρας; c. 490 BC – c. 420 BC)[1] was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. He is numbered as one of the sophists by Plato. In his dialogue Protagoras, Plato credits him with inventing the role of the professional sophist.

> Protagoras also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, "Man is the measure of all things", interpreted by Plato to mean that there is no absolute truth but that which individuals deem to be the truth.

> Although there is reason to question the extent of the interpretation of his arguments that has followed, that concept of individual relativity was revolutionary for the time, and contrasted with other philosophical doctrines **that claimed the universe was based on something objective, outside human influence or perceptions.** [Protagoras Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagoras)
	
	
### Myth of Prometheus

Humans were naked, he gave humans **ART & Technology** against insufficient natural conditions.

> In Greek mythology, Prometheus (/prəˈmiːθiːəs/; Greek: Προμηθεύς, pronounced [promɛːtʰéu̯s], possibly meaning "forethought")[1] is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who is credited with the creation of man from clay, and who defies the gods by stealing fire and giving it to humanity as civilization. Prometheus is known for his intelligence and as a champion of humankind[2] and also seen as the author of the human arts and sciences generally. He is sometimes presented as the father of Deucalion, the hero of the flood story.

> The punishment of Prometheus as a consequence of the theft is a major theme of his, and is a popular subject of both ancient and modern culture. Zeus, king of the Olympian gods, sentenced the Titan to eternal torment for his transgression. The immortal was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle, the emblem of Zeus, was sent to eat Prometheus' liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. (In ancient Greece, the liver was often thought to be the seat of human emotions.)[3] Prometheus was eventually freed by the hero Heracles.

> In another myth, Prometheus establishes the form of animal sacrifice practiced in ancient Greek religion.

> Evidence of a cult to Prometheus himself is not widespread. He was a focus of religious activity mainly at Athens, where he was linked to Athena and Hephaestus, other Greek deities of creative skills and technology.[4]

> In the Western classical tradition, Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving, particularly the quest for scientific knowledge, and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences. In particular, he was regarded in the Romantic era as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy: Mary Shelley, for instance, gave The Modern Prometheus as the subtitle to her novel Frankenstein (1818).

### Aristotle's Ontology

## Problems vs Emotions

### Eco Pathos

* Deep Emotion - Hysteric (Guilt does not help)
* Rage of Greta. May be not long lasting. 
* Could be some kind of Catharsis?

> Representatives of Representatives

### Thinking vs. Acting

Thinking is about:

* Class
* Rational
* Silence
* Critical Thinking

Acting:

* Rally / Demonstration
* Political Expression
* Not Programmatical
* Empathy

**Media became stage of tragedy and drama.**

Us vs. Them thinking. But, optimistic about dialog. No common language is a problem. Less polarization is the goal.

### Hardness vs. Weakness

* Hardship
* Everything is hard, no chance to be weak. 
* Being weak is not allowed. 
* Everything is going to be hard.
* How we keep our living standards in today's world without job security?
* Super hard to sustain your job.

> Sometimes I can be weak. This is normal.

#### Marvel Superheroes

* Evil vs. good.
* Mythology
* Supporting the hero
* Even spider man has super powers.

> Never ending story.

Somebody else is fighting for us. 

What are we fighting for? Exploitative corporations? We save capitalist world?

## What is our role as an artist?

Beauty vs Art (Art can be a bubble, can be isolated.) In Czechia, art is a closed community. 

> GHMP opening

## Subliminal Insight

Cultivation of ourselves. %3 Art graduates are not working in Art.
