## Identity Politics

Useful and unuseful labels. Politics was healthy contest of ideas. Right vs. Left. However it changed. Today is mostly about marketing of ideas and popularism. (Michelle Houllebecq is an important name.

## Concept Portmanteau

* We have to be ready for State Examination
* It's not about our knowledge or opinions but how we use these ideas and knowledge.

## Philosophy

Is mostly footnotes of Plato. We will investigate Plato's cave.

> Protagoras (/proʊˈtæɡərəs/; Greek: Πρωταγόρας; c. 490 BC – c. 420 BC)[1] was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. He is numbered as one of the sophists by Plato. In his dialogue Protagoras, Plato credits him with inventing the role of the professional sophist.

> Protagoras also is believed to have created a major controversy during ancient times through his statement that, "Man is the measure of all things", interpreted by Plato to mean that there is no absolute truth but that which individuals deem to be the truth.

> Although there is reason to question the extent of the interpretation of his arguments that has followed, that concept of individual relativity was revolutionary for the time, and contrasted with other philosophical doctrines that claimed the universe was based on something objective, outside human influence or perceptions.

**Media became stage of tragedy and drama.**

Us vs. Them thinking. But, optimistic about dialog. No common language is a problem. Less polarization is the goal.

* Hardship
* Everything is hard, no chance to be weak. 
* Being weak is not allowed.

Somebody else is fighting for us. 

What are we fighting for? Exploitative corporations? We save capitalist world?
