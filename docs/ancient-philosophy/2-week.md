Cynofuturism

## Sirens

They are irresistible. Ulysses, gods are playful. (Movie 1965)

* Semiology: system of meanings

Barthes says: Mythology is a sort of speech.

1. Signifier
2. Signified
3. Sign

## Epos

No linear logic. Ulysses vs. Poseidon. Adorno and Horkheim calls him "Proto Capitalist". Others are working and he listens to sirens. (Similar to Duck Tales episode.)

Homer: epic dimension.

Duck tales: Why everything is about money?

## Adorno And Horkheim asked

Why this happened? WWII? Holocaust? We had everyhting. Englightment. Kant's reason? Why?

Because they were over rational. They were still within some sort of logic, but they implemented a perverse realization of Enlightment.

### Being Practical

To ignore everything and paying attention to your labor. (The old man of Chernobyl HBO Episode 1)

## The problem of Hierarchy

Odysseus has workers. Sirens are representing art. I control myself and I enjoy the beauty. I have a cultural and social seat.

Mythos is simplified. 

Logos explaining things as they are.

What did godzilla symbolized? (Another movie to watch. At what year?)

Hypernormalization movie. 2010 2:40:00 September 11. How did we get there?

Alternatives are dangerous and they mean apocalypse. We should protect the SYSTEM.

## Critical Thory

Adorno. Humans are born into some conditions and they accept them, they play their role.

## Semitoics

Science about signs.
