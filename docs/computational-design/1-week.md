## Emergence

Emergence is a concept which is hard to define. And it's does not have an exact definition. 

Literally, in english,it means that something has appeared. 

Technology could be good, for creating jobs, better health and can also be bad, drugs and bad working conditions.

Geoffrey West says that 21st century is going to be about complexity. Scientific way is about comlex patterns, self organizing processes.

G. H. Lewis talks about something resultant vs. something emergent. 

### Reductionist Approach

What we mean by resultant, in 17th and 18th century, reductionist approach was found. Big problems could be solved by subdividing them into smaller problems. 

However limits of reduction appeared when body was dissected.

#### Deductive vs inductive reasoning

Deductive reasoning is mostly about mechanical problems.

Darwin says that nature does not take leaps. 

G. H. Lewis says that things in nature does not have mechanical solutions. 

#### Motion vs. Cooking

Cooking is like chemistry or a chemical reaction. Can be considered "emergent". Mixing gasses, H and O and there is no reaction but creating H2O using gasses is different.

When things are not explainable using mechanical approach, it bring us (scientists) unhappines.

Russel says that things are considered emergent until scientist understand the nature of it.

Turing pattern is an example to emergence.

* Gray Scott: Equations, Reaction, Diffusion
* Steven Wolfram: Math can solve all problems
* Cellular Automata

### Char Choto

It was a local nomadic population, there was class hierarchy and surplus of work. People was talking with each other, bosses vs. resources. This was an example of social emergence. 

> Ecosystem changes are emergent.

Geners, ants, ant nests are following simple rules. They sense feromons, detect positive feedback and cna generate extremely complex systems and structures. Using clay, ants show an example of synergic construction.

This procedure is different than layouts and fullfilling between the grid. This kind of layout is called as a "Rule based layout".

Another name for it is "No plan architecture". It appears under no authorithy. Can be observed at some cities, refugee camps and patterns of bacteria.

Slime mold is another example to it.

This type of funghi is behaves like using algorithms of graph theory. (Is also used to find shortest path in graphs.) Comparing efficiency of roadmaps. (Looks like lighting strike)

### The re-emergence of Emergence.
