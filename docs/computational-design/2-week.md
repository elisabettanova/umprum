## Architecture after Printing

* Paperless Studio (Bernard Schumi) is an interesting experiment.
* Parc de la Vilette
* Writing on paper is not allowed.
* Anything should be digital

Vitrivius - 10 Books on architecture.

There was problem on illustrations. When copied, inconsistencies increased. 

Architectural illustrations were kept in secret, due to rival architecture schools. There were almost no drawings. Architect was telling constructors what to do.

### 3 Kinds of Signs

1. Icon - Has visual resemblance. Painting of something.
2. Index - Direct contact with item. Shadow, mask, film, step in the mud.
3. Symbol - American flag, no visual resemblance, people agreed on the meaning

**Before:** direct touch of artisan in the buildings.

Brunelleschi was a young gold designer. (D'uomo di Firenze) He created step by step instructions. And created models and skecthes for himself.

Alberti's **pantograph** - Digitalization - Defined Distance and Angle for strict drawing. (Polar coordinates) It was hard. Nobody used. Took a lot of time. But was innovative.

Gutenberg invented letterpress around the same time. Book printing. It was purely analog. (index) Direct contact between original and copy. There was no **loss**. Illustrations were easily added to books.

## Book printing was a real Revolution

* Thanks to book printing, and architect in London did not to have to travel to Italy, Rome. 
* It also allowed architectural movements to spread.
* Copy of buildings can be made.

Development of geometry and mathematics also helped.

## Frank Gehry's Digitalization

Frank Gehry's digitalizaion methodologies for saving complex shapes.

He used Catia software. It allowed to design aerodynamic, smooth shapes. It was using curves and splines and was used in airplane design.

There was huge waste of time in Analog - Digital - Analog - Digital conversion. 

Clay - Computer - Paper - Clay - Model.

## Generative Design

It starts digital design with defining rules. It overcomes the limits of human modelling.

Coding, 3D printing allowed crazy detail designs.

Material & Technology, again, was the only limitation. *Printer resolution for example.*

* Define rule, then generate.

(To note: Patric Bedarf)

Notation is used for communication. (Minecraft software?)

Mass Production - Custom Production

Economy of scale (Industrial big machines)

Mass customization (Small home size machines)

* Printing of newspaper
* Online newspapers (Easy to customize all copies at the same time)

Note down **"the wiki house"**.

Third industrial revolution. It's easier to ship recipes than biscuists. - Keynes

Factories are everywhere.
