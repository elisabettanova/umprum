* It will be thought with social and political context in this class.
* Not to memorize dates or names.
* But some names should be known.

> Big names vs. Big Stories vs. Basics.

**Design profession was born with Industrial revolution because designer and creator (maker) was not the same thing anymore.**

The word *"disegno"* means the ability to draw, thinking with hand. Giorgo Vasari, as a proto art historian, used this term. (And he did not mean only craft.)

## Industrial Revolution 1770 - 1840

Maker and Designer did not mean the same thing anymore. 

Starts when James Watt invented the steam engine at 1775. It allowed faster and cheaper production. Thanks to that, people's living standard was growing. 

The pioneer countries were Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary Empire.

### Negative aspects

There were negative aspects of Industrial Revolution as well. It was damaging the ecology. Hygiene and dirt issues were common. Work force were dealing with these issues. 

## New inventions

[Spin Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=an4hi0knlaA) allowed creating fabrics easier. 

Textile production was located in Manchester.

1764, *"spinning jenny"* was invented.

### Printing

1. Calico Printing. (Designer brings money to the company)
2. Copperplate Printing
3. Roller Printing - 1840. Increased production from 1. million to 16. million

Competition was equal to have better designs and it allowed more profits. (Oriental patterns were also discovered)

## Man & Machine

Before industrial revolution, if you'd need a chair, you had to go to **The Artisan**. You had to describe the chair you wanted and did not know about the outcome.

**Taylorism:** Break every action into small simple segments of tasks.

**Fordism:** Standardising output of collective assembly lines that consisted of small deskilled tasks. Products were chosen from catalogues. Tools and Machines over the people. 

To have the concept of **design** alienization is crucial.

### Beautiful Machines

Machines were scary at first and people did not like them. There were new examples of machines that were architectured for not to look scary. (Not that alien.)

## Josiah Wesgewood 1730 - 1795

> Josiah Wedgwood (12 July 1730 – 3 January 1795) was an English potter and entrepreneur. He founded the Wedgwood company. He is credited with the industrialisation of the manufacture of pottery; "it was by intensifying the division of labour that Wedgwood brought about the reduction of cost which enabled his pottery to find markets in all parts of Britain, and also of Europe and America."[1] The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion.[2] His expensive goods were in much demand from the nobility, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society.[3] Every new invention that Wedgwood produced – green glaze, creamware, black basalt and jasper – was quickly copied.[4] Having once achieved perfection in production, he achieved perfection in sales and distribution.[5] His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.[6]

>Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as the inventor of modern marketing.[7] He pioneered direct mail, money back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying pattern boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues.[8]

>A prominent abolitionist, Wedgwood is remembered too for his "Am I Not a Man And a Brother?" anti-slavery medallion. He was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family, and he was the grandfather of Charles and Emma Darwin. [Joshiah Wedgwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Wedgwood)

Founded Erturia factory at 1762. The products were inspired from anicent Roman / Greek design which was believed best kind of craftsmanship. 

In the year 1748, Pompei was found and interest to archeology was sparked.

John Wedgewood created **first showroom** in 1774. He also created the first **catalogue**.

He know the importance of creating demand and was a great marketing mind.

### Technological Optimism

Was a kind of a communist utopia. Machines as a way to make life simpler. Nostalgia was resemblance of innocent times.

## The great exhibition of London 1851

![Great Exhibition](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/The_Crystal_Palace_in_Hyde_Park_for_Grand_International_Exhibition_of_1851.jpg/1920px-The_Crystal_Palace_in_Hyde_Park_for_Grand_International_Exhibition_of_1851.jpg)

> The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations or The Great Exhibition (sometimes referred to as the Crystal Palace Exhibition in reference to the temporary structure in which it was held), an international exhibition, took place in Hyde Park, London, from 1 May to 15 October 1851. It was the first in a series of World's Fairs, exhibitions of culture and industry that became popular in the 19th century.

## Ornament

Calico printing is the origin. Designer was seen as a decorator. 

### William Dyce

> The love of ornament is a tendency of our being. We all are sensible that mechanical contrivances are like skeletons without skin, like birds without feathers .... This feeling is not the offspring of a refined state of society; for we discover among savages the exercise of ornament as art. 
> 
> ... Do not savages paint ornaments on their skins, before they have learnt the art of weaving dresses to cover themselves withal? Are not their bows and arrows, their spears and war clubs, their canoes and paddles, all decorated with ornamental painting and sculpture? Does it not thus appear that ornamental design has had its birth long before the very conception of the fine arts? And shall it be said that a kind of art, to the practice of which all mankind savage or civilised, have in all ages been impelled, does not hold a high rank, either considered philosophically or in relation to its utility, in adorning the artificial world in which we live?

* Beauty is important and crucial for humans. Makes us different from animals.

### Alois Reigl

> Alois Riegl (14 January 1858, Linz – 17 June 1905, Vienna) was an Austrian art historian, and is considered a member of the Vienna School of Art History. He was one of the major figures in the establishment of art history as a self-sufficient academic discipline, and one of the most influential practitioners of formalism. [Alois Riegl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Riegl)

## Tradition vs. Revival

### Gottfried Semper

> Gottfried Semper (German: [ˌɡɔtfriːt ˈzɛmpɐ]; 29 November 1803 – 15 May 1879) was a German architect, art critic, and professor of architecture, who designed and built the Semper Opera House in Dresden between 1838 and 1841. In 1849 he took part in the May Uprising in Dresden and was put on the government's wanted list. Semper fled first to Zürich and later to London. Later he returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries.

> Semper wrote extensively about the origins of architecture, especially in his book The Four Elements of Architecture from 1851, and he was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the polychrome architectural style of ancient Greece. Semper designed works at all scales, from major urban interventions like the re-design of the Ringstraße in Vienna, to a baton for Richard Wagner.[1] His unrealised design for an opera house in Munich was, without permission, adapted by Wagner for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Semper)

* Art vs Industry: He criticised The Great Exhibiton

> For Semper, among these elements the most important one was the enclosing fabric. Like dressing covers the human body, enclosing fabric does the same for a building. In other words, building enclosure acts like the dressing of a building according to him.
In a recent reading of Semper’s theory, Kenneth Frampton reduces four elements into two and claims that building consisted of the tectonics of the frame and the stereotomics of the earthwork (1995). To illustrate his two-fold explanation, Frampton draws on an alternative paradigm: the building traditions in Japanese culture where weaving and binding constitute the core of architectural activities. This paper seeks to reveal two hints traditional Japanese architecture offered to Frampton for his reinterpretation of Semper’s theory. For this purpose, Semper’s ideas about the metaphor of ‘dressing,’ knotting and the creation of ceremonial space will be analyzed in view of Japanese tradition of building and tea houses.

### Democracy and City Hall

With the rise of the idea of democracy, people start to build City Halls. Reference was the ancient greece. 

Also national theaters were built. This was also a reference to ancient greek culture.

## Design Education or Education of Designer

Lada Hubatova Vackova [Silent Revolutions in Ornament](https://www.academia.edu/463977/Silent_revolutions_in_ornament_1880-1920)

Stylization-Ornaments. They imitate nature. Goes to geometry. Little designers to create.

## Bauhaus

* Changed everything about design education

Oven Jones had islamic inspiration. He designed the interior of Crystal Palace. Created Government School of Design. Influenced Orientalists.

> There is an Oriental Sourt in South Kensington Museum.

London Exhibition is deeply connected with colonialism and sparked interest into orient. (Japonomania)
