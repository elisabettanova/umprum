# History of Design in 20cc. - Week 2

## Societal changes in Great Britain

Society was seen as a beehive. Everyone had it own role in the class system.

It was influenced by protestant ethics. Bees were seen as the symbol of hard work. Social ladder can be climbed by hard work.


## Arts and Crafts movement

1880 - 1910

### Walter Crane

> Walter Crane (15 August 1845 – 14 March 1915) was an English artist and book illustrator. He is considered to be the most influential, and among the most prolific, children’s book creators of his generation[1] and, along with Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, one of the strongest contributors to the child's nursery motif that the genre of English children's illustrated literature would exhibit in its developmental stages in the later 19th century.

> Crane's work featured some of the more colourful and detailed beginnings of the child-in-the-garden motifs that would characterize many nursery rhymes and children's stories for decades to come. He was part of the Arts and Crafts movement and produced an array of paintings, illustrations, children's books, ceramic tiles and other decorative arts. Crane is also remembered for his creation of a number of iconic images associated with the international Socialist movement.

### Augustus Pugin 

>Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (/ˈpjuːdʒɪn/ PEW-jin; 1 March 1812 – 14 September 1852) was an English architect, designer, artist and critic who is principally remembered for his pioneering role in the Gothic Revival style of architecture. His work culminated in designing the interior of the Palace of Westminster in Westminster, London, England, and its iconic clock tower, later renamed the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the bell known as Big Ben. Pugin designed many churches in England and some in Ireland and Australia.[2] He was the son of Auguste Pugin, and the father of Edward Welby and Peter Paul Pugin, who continued his architectural firm as Pugin & Pugin.[3] He also created Alton Castle in Alton, Staffordshire.

### John Ruskin and William Morris

You can see how the item is working, you can see the material. They are quite functional. 

Arts and Crafts movement members were not against the industrial revolution.

Gothic revival was apparent. Items had medieval references. There was an obivous inspiration from middle ages but they kept as functional as possible. They did not lost reference to Kant.

They believed that beauty is independent. They were against eclecticism. It was lack of quality. They criticised it since 1840's. They also rejected excessive ornamentation.

They were not anti industrial or anti modern.

Illustration is still important but it's simplified.

## Classless Design

They said that mass production was lacking quality and ended up at poor people. They asked one question: **How to make art as a part of the everyday life?**

> William Morris - Society - Hand Made

Medieval Guilds vs. Factories. We should go back to it. Factories are dehumanizing.

## John Ruskin 1818 - 1900

He was more radical than William Morris. He cared about social context. 

Pre-raphaelites, inspired Gaudi. 

Healthy & moral society requires independent workers who design the things they make.

Ornament should symbolize the struggle. Hard work is important.

## John Ruskin - Social Criticism

### The guild of St. George

Self sustainable, sort of a hippy commune. Rural economy. (Check village institues of Turkey)

It had land, agricultural labor, school, library, art galleries. (Garden City movement)

Education was mode practical.

## William Morris (1834 - 1896)
* Founded Socialist League 1884
* Inspired McMurdo

* Idea of Cooperation (Small communities)
* He defended the idea of "Art for All" but his products were expensive
* Naturalism in Ornament
* Go to Nature and draw something

This kind of realistic, nature imitating ornaments were considered fake. This was dishonest. It lies to the observer.

He created buildings using just bricks, showing materials, being sincere to the viewer. (Architecture)
