He is credited with the industrialisation of the manufacture of pottery; &quot;it was by intensifying the division of labour that Wedgwood brought about the reduction of cost which enabled his pottery to find markets in all parts of Britain, and also of Europe and America.&quot;[1] The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion.[2] His expensive goods were in much demand from the nobility, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society.[3] Every new invention that Wedgwood produced – green glaze, creamware, black basalt and jasper – was quickly copied.[4] Having once achieved perfection in production, he achieved perfection in sales and distribution.[5] His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.[6]</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution and growth in wealth of the middle classes that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as the inventor of modern marketing.[7] He pioneered direct mail, money back guarantees, travelling salesmen, carrying pattern boxes for display, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues.[8]</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>A prominent abolitionist, Wedgwood is remembered too for his &quot;Am I Not a Man And a Brother?&quot; anti-slavery medallion.

In 1849 he took part in the May Uprising in Dresden and was put on the government's wanted list. Semper fled first to Zürich and later to London. Later he returned to Germany after the 1862 amnesty granted to the revolutionaries.</p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>Semper wrote extensively about the origins of architecture, especially in his book The Four Elements of Architecture from 1851, and he was one of the major figures in the controversy surrounding the polychrome architectural style of ancient Greece. Semper designed works at all scales, from major urban interventions like the re-design of the Ringstraße in Vienna, to a baton for Richard Wagner.[1] His unrealised design for an opera house in Munich was, without permission, adapted by Wagner for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Semper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></blockquote> <ul><li>Art vs Industry: He criticised The Great Exhibiton</li></ul> <blockquote><p>For Semper, among these elements the most important one was the enclosing fabric. Like dressing covers the human body, enclosing fabric does the same for a building. In other words, building enclosure acts like the dressing of a building according to him.
In a recent reading of Semper’s theory, Kenneth Frampton reduces four elements into two and claims that building consisted of the tectonics of the frame and the stereotomics of the earthwork (1995). To illustrate his two-fold explanation, Frampton draws on an alternative paradigm: the building traditions in Japanese culture where weaving and binding constitute the core of architectural activities. This paper seeks to reveal two hints traditional Japanese architecture offered to Frampton for his reinterpretation of Semper’s theory. For this purpose, Semper’s ideas about the metaphor of ‘dressing,’ knotting and the creation of ceremonial space will be analyzed in view of Japanese tradition of building and tea houses. <a href="https://www.academia.edu/8348763/Facade_in_traditional_Japanese_architecture_a_predecessor_approach_to_the_dressing_metaphor_of_Gottfried_Semper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resource<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p></blockquote> <h3 id="democracy-and-city-hall"><a href="#democracy-and-city-hall" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Democracy and City Hall</h3> <p>With the rise of the idea of democracy, people start to build City Halls.
